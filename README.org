Efficiently create Anki flashcards from your notes.

I created this package to facilitate faster creation of Anki cards while I study
utilizing the fantastic text editing of Emacs.

I mostly use it inside [[https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter][org-noter]].

* Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

Install these packages:
+ =anki-editor=
  While not /required/, this is the package that allows the output of my package
  to be sent to Anki (utilizing the [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159][AnkiConnect]] addon).

Then put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'ankifier)
  #+END_SRC

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      :depth 0
:END:

Run one of these commands on an active region:

+ =ankifier-create-basic-from-region=: Create Basic question(s) from active
  region.
+ =ankifier-create-cloze-from-region=: Create Cloze question(s) from active
  region.

Variables

+ Set =ankifier-insert-elsewhere= to =t= if you want the questions to be created
  under a =* Cards= org heading (This is what I mostly do).

  The name of the heading can be edited using =ankifier-cards-heading=.

+ =ankifier-anki-cloze-note-type= sets the card type for cloze cards.

+ =ankifier-anki-basic-note-type= sets the card type for basic cards.


For a *basic* question, the questions must be separated by two newlines
and have a single question mark to indicate the /Question/ part and the /Answer/
part.


For a *cloze* question, the sentences must be separated by two new lines.

- This package would not have been possible without [[https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor][anki-editor]], which allows
  the flash cards to be sent to Anki in the first place.
