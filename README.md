# Screencast

<a id="org65c0c62"></a>

# Installation


<a id="org05c8542"></a>

## Manual

Install these required packages:

-   `anki-editor`

Then put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init file:

    (require 'ankifier)


<a id="org7b565c2"></a>

# Usage

Run one of these commands on an active region:

-   `ankifier-create-basic-from-region`: Create Basic question(s) from active
    region.
-   `ankifier-create-cloze-from-region`: Create Cloze question(s) from active
    region.
-   Set `ankifier-insert-elsewhere` to `t` if you want the questions to be created
    under a `* Cards` org heading (This is what I mostly do).
    The name of the heading can be edited using `ankifier-cards-heading`.

Note that for a **basic** question, the questions must be separated by two newlines
and have a single question mark to indicate the *Question* part and the *Answer*
part.
